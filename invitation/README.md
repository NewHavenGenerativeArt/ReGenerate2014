Re:Generate 2014 Invitation Generator
=====================================

This sketch generates the invitation for Re:Generate 2014.

Many thanks to @quephird for supplying the background, pretty much the
foundation of the whole piece.

The invitation is pretty dull by gen-art standards - it's basic typography,
with a sort-of particle system flocking to the "re:generate" text.

This was my first time working with a typograhical grid layout (in Processing
at least). It was much easier to work with, on a grid. I recommend it.
